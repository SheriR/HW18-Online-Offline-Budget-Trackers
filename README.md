# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

A Budget Tracker application that allows a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
